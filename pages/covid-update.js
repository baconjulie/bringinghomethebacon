                  Dear family and friends,
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We hope you and yours are healthy and safe during this time,
                  and we appreciate all the love and support weâ€™ve received from
                  each of you. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has created much
                  uncertainty, we still can't wait to get married on May 29th,
                  2021, even if it looks a little different than we originally
                  planned.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We are monitoring the ongoing global pandemic and the
                  implications it means for guest size, health and safety
                  precautions to ensure we are following CDC guidelines. While
                  we hope that by next spring it will be safe to gather and
                  celebrate, we will be posting updates to this space as needed.
                  Thank you for your patience and understanding, and we cannot
                  wait to be together with you in person again!
                  <br />
